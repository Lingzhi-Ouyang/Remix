# Remix

This is the artifact (demo) of "Multi-Grained Specifications for Distributed System Model Checking and Verification" presented at EuroSys'25.

**Remix** is a tooling support for the verification using multi-grained specifications. It interfaces the TLC model checker, and provides conformance checking and deterministic execution of model-level traces.



## Overview

### Pre-requisites for use

* Java 11+
* Python 3+
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.5+

## Quick Start

Generate model-level traces:

```bash
cd generator
./run.sh   			         # or: ./generate_trace.sh && ./read_trace.sh
```



Build the checker and replay the model-level traces (here use the trace directory `demo`  as an example):

```bash
cd script
./buildAndReplay.sh demo 		# or: ./build.sh && ./replay.sh demo
```
